Implements two tests for same-source of toolmarks. The chumbley_non_random() test follows the paper "An Improved Version of a Tool Mark Comparison Algorithm" by Hadler and Morris (2017) <doi:10.1111/1556-4029.13640>. This is an extension of the Chumbley score as previously described in "Validation of Tool Mark Comparisons Obtained Using a Quantitative, Comparative, Statistical Algorithm" by Chumbley et al (2010) <doi:10.1111/j.1556-4029.2010.01424.x>. fixed_width_no_modeling() is based on correlation measures in a diamond shaped area of the toolmark as described in Hadler (2017).
