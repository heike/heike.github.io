Modern Parallel Coordinate Plots have been introduced in the 1980s as 
    a way to visualize arbitrarily many numeric variables. This Grammar of Graphics implementation
    also incorporates categorical variables into the plots in a principled manner. 
    By separating the data managing part from the visual rendering, we give full access
    to the users while keeping the number of parameters manageably low.
