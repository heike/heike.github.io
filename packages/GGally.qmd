The R package 'ggplot2' is a plotting system based on the
    grammar of graphics.  'GGally' extends 'ggplot2' by adding several
    functions to reduce the complexity of combining geometric objects with
    transformed data.  Some of these functions include a pairwise plot
    matrix, a two group pairwise plot matrix, a parallel coordinates plot,
    a survival plot, and several functions to plot networks.
